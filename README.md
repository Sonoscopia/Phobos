# PHOBOS
Code and instructional content

## Description
Phobos is a set of small robots and automatic music generation devices that form a Dysfunctional Robotic Orchestra, an orchestra with strange instruments with defects, genetic mutations and erratic behaviors.

Phobos represents a critique of the technological overlapping over human thought, the function of labor and modern forms of slavery, as well as an historical retrospective of the various attempts of human liberation through machines, its technological utopias, the advances and retreats of freedoms. Its name comes from Greek mythology, where Phobos is the incarnation of fear, and is also the name of the largest moon of Mars, doomed to disappear due to the proximity of its orbit to the planet.
