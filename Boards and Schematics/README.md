# IMPORTANT NOTICE
These boards were designed to be etched and drilled by CNC at FEUP (Faculty of Engineering - University of Porto) in 2015. 

The boards might need some revision for modern print (ex: JLCPCB or PCBWAY)!!

If you want to make one for yourself I would advise making EnsembleTwo (check schematics to see which one better fits your needs...)

The Ensemble boards used RJ45 connectors, packing 4 signals in one cable. To use independent outputs the InstrumentHubs have a RJ45 input connector and separate output DC (5.5x2.1mm) connectors.
